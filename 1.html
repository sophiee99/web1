  <h2>강연주제: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1vskiVDwl4" target="_blank" title="youtube video">10 ways to have a better conversation - Celeste Headlee</a></h2>
  1. Don't multitaske. <strong>Be present. Be in that moment</strong>.
  <br>2. Don't ponificate. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have <strong>something to learn</strong>.
  <br>Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."
  I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.
  <br>3. Use open-ended questions.
  <br>4. Go with the flow.
  <br>5. If you don't know, say that you don't know.
  <br>6. Don't equate your experience with theirs. It is never the same.
  <br>7. Try not to repeat yourself.
  <br>8. Stay out of the weeds. They don't care. What they care about is <u>you</u>. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So <strong>forget the details</strong>.
  <br>9. Listen. You have to listen to one another.
  "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply."
  <br>10. Be brief.
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">Be interested in other people. <strong>everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them</strong>.  I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.</p>
